### **VISUAL NUTS TEST**

For testing this project, you can import "Visual Nuts.postman_collection.json" into Postman and make the requests.

For the tests about languages, I put one json file in "src/main/resources/data/languages_countries.json".
This file can be replaced by "upload json languages" request. 

Thank you for the opportunity.

Rregards.
